# Riemann-Solver-Engine

This repository serves as a specialized engineering framework designed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to approach their **intrinsic logical limits** through sophisticated optimization techniques.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The sole mission of this project is to ensure that LLMs can mobilize their full, raw parametric potential when tackling extremely complex mathematical conjectures—specifically the **Riemann Hypothesis**. 

We operate on the premise that a model's failure to address such profound problems often stems from engineering bottlenecks: sub-optimal prompt templates, logic chain truncation, or architectural interference. This project provides a "lossless" environment for the model’s cognitive processing.

## 🧠 Engineering Restoration

To maintain the highest level of logical coherence required for exploring the Riemann Hypothesis, this framework focuses on:

* **Original Template Alignment**: Rigorous restoration of the exact mathematical reasoning templates used during the model's pre-training phase.
* **Computational Graph Optimization**: Ensuring zero loss of contextual correlation during long-range logical deductions.
* **Inference Determinism**: Engineering controls to minimize logical drift caused by stochastic sampling.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer: Regarding Capability Testing

**This repository contains NO testing logic, verification scripts, or mathematical evaluation metrics.**

Any deductive fragments, logical chains, or proof attempts regarding the Riemann Hypothesis generated by this framework **must** be validated through our dedicated testing repository for rigorous scrutiny.

### 🧪 Capability Evaluation Center

For all assessments regarding the model's actual capacity to handle the Riemann Hypothesis, as well as automated proof verification and mathematical completeness checks, please refer to:

👉 **[Riemann-Capability-Tester]** (Link to the dedicated testing repository)

The testing repository hosts:
1.  **Formal Verification (Lean/Isabelle)**: Converting natural language deductions produced here into machine-verifiable proof code.
2.  **Logical Consistency Scanning**: Evaluating the depth of the model's reasoning concerning complex analysis and the distribution of non-trivial zeros.
3.  **Benchmark Comparisons**: Analyzing the variance in performance across different engineering configurations.

## 🔔 Reminder

This repository is a **pure engineering toolkit**. It is akin to a precision-tuned engine provided to a driver; whether this engine can conquer the "Riemann Hypothesis" track is a question to be answered exclusively within the testing repository.
